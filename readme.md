Welcome to the ultimate web-based Nintendo 64 emulator! Play your favorite N64 games directly in your browser with ease. This emulator supports loading ROMs and allows for a nostalgic gaming experience without the need for physical hardware.

## Features

- **Web-Based:** No need for additional software; just a modern web browser.
- **Easy ROM Loading:** Load your ROM files directly from a URL or your local machine.
- **Controller Support:** Use your keyboard or gamepad to control the action.
- **Customizable Settings:** Adjust graphics and controls to fit your preferences.

## How to Use

1. **Open the Emulator:** Load the emulator in your web browser.
2. **Prepare Your ROM File:** Ensure that the ROM file is a `.z64` file contained within a ZIP archive. The emulator expects a ZIP file that includes the Z64 ROM.
3. **Enter ROM URL:** Provide the URL of the ZIP file containing the `.z64` ROM you want to play.
4. **Select Core:** Choose the appropriate core for the game you’re loading. **Spoiler Alert:** There is seriously only one core option in the dropdown that you can really pick—no need to stress over it, just select the only choice available and you’re good to go!
5. **Play:** Enjoy your game!

 If you want to add your own game, then download the zip file for your game from a website like [emulatorgames.net](https://www.emulatorgames.net/roms/nintendo-64/) and then upload the zip file to a website or web server and then you can enter the URL.

## Can it Run Doom?

### Spoiler Alert: It Can!

Yes, our emulator can indeed run the legendary Doom 64! Because who doesn’t want to face off against demons in a web browser? To play Doom 64, ensure you have the ROM in a ZIP file format with the `.z64` file inside. Use the following ROM URL:

[`https://n64emulate.github.io/n64emulate/examples/roms/zips/Doom%2064%20(U)%20[!].zip`](https://n64emulate.github.io/n64emulate/examples/roms/zips/Doom%2064%20(U)%20[!].zip)

**Instructions:**

1. Ensure the ZIP file contains the `.z64` ROM of the game.
2. Copy the URL above.
3. Paste it into the ROM URL input field in the emulator.
4. Select the appropriate core if prompted. **Spoiler Alert:** There is seriously only one core option in the dropdown that you can really pick—just select it and you're set!
5. Hit 'Load Game' and prepare for some classic demon-slaying action.

So, grab your virtual shotgun and get ready to wreak havoc on the denizens of hell—all without leaving your browser!

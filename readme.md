Welcome to the ultimate web-based Nintendo 64 emulator! Play your favorite N64 games directly in your browser with ease. This emulator supports loading ROMs and allows for a nostalgic gaming experience without the need for physical hardware.

## Features

## How to Use

1. **Open the Emulator:** Load the emulator in your web browser.

3. **Enter ROM URL:** Provide the URL of the ZIP file containing the `.z64` ROM you want to play.
4. **Select Core:** Choose the appropriate core for the game you’re loading. **Spoiler Alert:** There is seriously only one core option in the dropdown that you can really pick—no need to stress over it, just select the only choice available and you’re good to go!
5. **Play:** Enjoy your game!

## Can it Run Doom?

### Spoiler Alert: It Can!

Yes, our emulator can indeed run the legendary Doom 64! Because who doesn’t want to face off against demons in a web browser? To play Doom 64, ensure you have the ROM in a ZIP file format with the `.z64` file inside. Use the following ROM URL:

**Instructions:**

1. Ensure the ZIP file contains the `.z64` ROM of the game.
2. Copy the URL above.
